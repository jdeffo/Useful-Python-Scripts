Created two python scripts:
    quickstart.py - utilizes the Gmail API and sends an email to a given user
    from my gmail address.
    TenEmails.py - Utilizes the Gmail API, but was used to study how spam filters
    work.  It is set to send 10 emails on a random interval, with a random subject
    and random body.  Each email is delivered without being caught as spam.  I believe
    if this was put into an infinite loop the emails would start to be caught
    as spam, however.  This has also never been used maliciously, and has only
    been tested out with my own accounts just to see what the gmail spam filters
    can and cannot catch
